Hi, I'm Tom.

I am building my own AI employee team and currently focused on the ResearcherZero project. The goal is to fight information overload and build deeper cognition workflows for research and engineering.

What I'm doing now:

- Building agent workflows for long-horizon research tasks
- Exploring memory, planning, and human-AI collaboration
- Writing logs and experiments as I learn

If you'd like to connect, find me on GitHub or send an email via the icons on the About page.
